# Your challenge

- You will need to create a [pokedex](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex) with the help of an api
- We know that already exists a lot of versions of it but, we want you to create a version of your own with a personal touch
- We are interested in your creativity and the way you write code. Using Typescript would be great, but not essential (feel free to use [CRA typescript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/))
- It doesn't have to be perfect, that's why we will not put so much attention on how it looks but it has to work properly   

## Requirements

- Use this api [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the data for what you need
- Create a React application

## Application Requirements:

1. A list page of all pokemon
2. A pokemon detail page, showing a user all the pokemon goodness:
    1. Image of the pokemon [hint: this can be found in one of the API responses, look for sprite information]
    2. A description
    3. Choose some of it's characteristics like: Stats, Abilities, Movements etc ... maximum 5
3. An option to search from the list page, where we can search for different pokemons and show the result
- You can use whatever UI library you prefer if it will be easy to build the app
- Demonstrate or consider your approach to testing / TDD, or provide a simpler explainer on how you'd test

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
